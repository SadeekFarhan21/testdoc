p4c is a reference compiler for the P4 programming language.It supports both P4-14 and P4-16; you can find more information about P4 [here](http://p4.org) and the specifications for both versions of the language [here](https://p4.org/specs). One fact attesting to the level of quality and completeness of p4c's code is that its front-end code, mid-end code, and p4c-graphs back end are used as the basis for at least one commercially supported P4 compiler.

p4c is modular; it provides a standard frontend and midend which can be combined with a target-specific backend to create a complete P4 compiler. The goal is tomake adding new backends easy.
